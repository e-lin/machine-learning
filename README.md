Overview
---
This is my machine learning practices in the machine learning course created by Stanford University on Coursera.

course link: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning][R1]


Main topics Iâ€™ve learned from this machine learning course
---

**Supervised learning**
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- neural networks
- SVMs

**Unsupervised learning**
- kmeans
- PCA
- anomaly detection

**Special topics**
- recommender system
- large scale machine leaning(mapReduce, parallel computing, CUDA)

**Insight**
- bias/variance, regularization;
- deciding what to do next: evaluation of leaning algorithms, learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis.
